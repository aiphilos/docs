4. Create your fist user by giving them an Username(Benutzername) and Password(Passwort). Then click "Absenden" to save your data.

5. As long as we are waiting for certification by Shopware, download our Shopware plugin from the [Shopware store](https://store.shopware.com/aiphi88293318735f/aiphilos-suche.html).
