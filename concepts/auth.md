# Auth

You can use Basic Authentication to access the API for your Cloud account. With Basic Authentication, you pass your credentials in each request to the API.

You can pass your credentials as a Base64-encoded header or as an URL parameter in an HTTP client.
When you pass your credentials in the header, you must Base64-encode them.
