# About

"aiPhilos Smart Product Search" is a product by aiPhilos GmbH. It is based on AI and was developed together with the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI).

aiPhilos supports plug and play and can be used directly with no setup required. The artificial intelligence understands natural search requests via speech or written text, is self-learning and requires no manual maintenance.

aiPhilos provides its own API, which can be used to map individual search experiences in online stores or digital assistants. In addition, plugins are available for Shopware, Magento and, in the future, for all other store systems widely used in German-speaking countries.
